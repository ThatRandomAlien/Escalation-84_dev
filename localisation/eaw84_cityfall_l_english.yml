 cityfall.100.t:0 "The Fall of Cloudbury"
 cityfall.100.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]The bastion of Griffonian republicanism and the former capital of the Duchy named after it, Cloudbury, has fallen to [new_controller.GetAdjective] attackers. The city had been fortified for decades by President-Marshal Kemerskai and his allies, not only to defend it from counter-revolutionary aggression but also from the warlords ruling the countryside. As such, the [old_controller.GetAdjective] garrison had an easy time repelling invaders at first, forcing their enemy to use more unorthodox tactics to seize the city. Night time raids across the river, airborne flanking maneuvers by winged infantry and various infiltration attempts were all utilized in tandem, yet in the end [new_controller.GetNameDef] had to rely on overwhelming numbers and firepower to gain a bittersweet victory."
